### Introduction to JavaScript

JavaScript  it's an interpreted programming language that runs on the client side:      
In other words, when we write JavaScript on a Web site: 
**The server** that the Web site is **hosted** on has nothing to do with executing that JavaScript.       
The javascript code is sent to the browser of the user and interpreted on their machine.

So there's different JS rendering engines used in different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge...)     
So all browsers have a slightly different interpretation.

## Set Up Environment:

#### Downloading and installing Node.js and NPM:
* Downloading Node:    
 [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* Downloading NPM:    
 `npm install -g npm`

#### Checking Node and NPM versions:
* Check my Node version using:    
 `node --version`
* Check my NPM version using:    
 `npm --version`
 
 #### Updating Node and NPM versions:

* Updating my Node version using:    
 [Node JS - Downloads](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* Update my NPM version using:    
 `npm install -g npm`
 
 ## Install node libraries:
 
 * Globally to the system:        
 It's just an application that you've installed to your computer using Node       
 It's not part of a project, it's not a project dependency       
 `npm install -g my_package_name`
 
  * Directly into a project:        
 Projects directory that does have a package.json file
 It's a N ode project and so you can install directly into that project.       
 `npm install -g create-react-app`
