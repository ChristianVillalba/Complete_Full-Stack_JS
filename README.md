### Introduction to JavaScript

JavaScript  it's an interpreted programming language that runs on the client side:      
In other words, when we write JavaScript on a Web site: 
**The server** that the Web site is **hosted** on has nothing to do with executing that JavaScript.       
The javascript code is sent to the browser of the user and interpreted on their machine.

So there's different JS rendering engines used in different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge...)     
So all browsers have a slightly different interpretation.
